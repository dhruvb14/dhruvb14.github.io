Welcome to ChocoStarter a Web application which will help you build a BoxStarter
installation script using a web gui (think Ninite for chocolatey). I am web developer
who often creates new VM's to test thing out and spend lots of time setting up my machines.
Boxstarter helps with my install process but there was no easy to use GUI I could navigate 
to on my VM's to build  a custom script similar to Ninite. So i created this simple GUI that
you can naviagte to in IE/Edge on a bare Windows box and get a full automated install of all
your favorite softwares.

Hope you enjoy it!

Please report bugs as this application is become a pet project of mine and I will often be updating
code to add features.
